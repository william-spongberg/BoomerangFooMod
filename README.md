Boomerang Foo: Chaos Mod
======================================

Boomerang Foo: Chaos Mod (BFoo for short) is a mod for the 2020 couch PvP party game *Boomerang Fu* by Cranky Watermelon. BFoo provides custom settings, powerup modifiers, and gamemodes. It is built with the [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/) runtime patching framework. The mod was originally created by @ws13sk and adapted to BepInEx by @Jeffjewett27. 

## Installation

1. Download `BoomerangFoo-<version>.zip` in the releases.
2. Unzip the files into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Boomerang Fu`. The BepInEx folder should be in the same folder as `Boomerang Fu.exe`.
3. Open the game to initialize the files and configs.

*Note: to update, you only need to replace the `BoomerangFoo.dll` file in `Bepinex/plugins/BoomerangFoo` with the `BoomerangFoo.dll` in the releases.*

## Disabling Mod

The simplest way to disable the mod is to remove `Bepinex/plugins/BoomerangFoo/BoomerangFoo.dll`. Copy it to a different location and restore it when you want to enable the mod again.

## Features

1. New gamemodes!
- Power Drain: Kill other players to get powerups and remove their powers.
